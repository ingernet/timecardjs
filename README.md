# timecardjs

## All I do is math. Seriously.

Don't get your hopes up. This is just a way for me to not have to pencil out minutes into fractions of hours as I'm hopping between billable projects. It is NOT data driven, it is NOT scaleable. It's just a counter. It is rudimentary, to say the least. Hardly any error checking. 

"Just be an adult, okay?" --timecardjs

## Installation
1. Clone the thing
1. Run `yarn install` to install the jQuery things I used
1. Open the file in a web browser.
1. Get to it

## Customization
Should you want to use this thing, you should:
1. Configure the `minTime` and `maxTime` values in assets/js/clockr.js. The values I chose represent the earliest and latest I actually want to be working on code. You might have different ideas.
1. Read up on the options available to you [here](http://jonthornton.github.io/jquery-timepicker/)
